          <h1>Vitoria Resende</h1>

          <p class="pitch">
            My name is Vitoria, and I am a bachelor’s student in Software Development at Bellevue College.
            I currently serve as the president of the Brazilian Club, where I help organize events and
            build community on campus. I’m especially interested in UX/UI design and hope to secure an
            internship to gain real-world experience and continue building strong portfolio projects.
            Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling, exploring good food, spending time outdoors, and sharing
            quality time with the people I love. I am excited to learn more in this class, ask questions,
            and create new things. Thank you!
          </p>

      <h1>Vitoria Resende</h1>

      <p class="pitch">
        My name is Vitoria, and I am a bachelor’s student in Software Development at Bellevue College. I currently serve as the president of the Brazilian Club, 
        where I help organize events and build community on campus. I’m especially interested in UX/UI design and hope to secure an internship to gain real-world
         experience and continue building strong portfolio projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling, exploring good food, spending time outdoors, and sharing 
         quality time with the people I love. I am excited to learn more in this class, ask questions, and create new things, thank you teacher!

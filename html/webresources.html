    <h2>1. Will AI Replace UX Designers?</h2>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/will-ai-replace-ux-designers/" target="_blank">
            UX Design Institute – Will AI Replace UX Designers?
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>
        This article explains how artificial intelligence is growing in the design industry,
        but it is very unlikely to replace UX designers. UX design depends on human skills
        like empathy, understanding user behavior, and collaboration. The article also shows
        how AI can help designers by improving efficiency, accessibility, and data analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        This resource is useful because it helps reduce fear about AI replacing design jobs.
        I will use it to understand how AI can support my work while keeping user-centered
        design as a priority.

    </p>
    <p>
        This article explains why many tech companies are laying off workers in 2025.

        slower growth, economic pressure, and companies shifting budgets toward AI.
        The article explains that this is more of a reset than a collapse of the tech industry.
    </p>
    <p>
        This resource helps me understand the current tech job market and what skills
        are important to stay competitive. I will use it to stay informed and focus on
